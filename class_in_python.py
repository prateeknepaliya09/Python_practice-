"""Define a class which has at least two methods:
getString: to get a string from console input
printString: to print the string in upper case.
Also please include simple test function to test the class methods.

Hints:
Use __init__ method to construct some parameters

Solution:"""

class InputOutString(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.s = ""

    def getString(self):
        self.s = raw_input()

    def printString(self):
        print self.s.upper()

strObj = InputOutString()
strObj.getString()
strObj.printString()
